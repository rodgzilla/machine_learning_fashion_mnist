# machine learning fashion mnist

A first couple of experiments on the Fashion MNIST dataset from
Zalando research.

This repository contains two neural networks, a very simple 4 layers
fully connected network that reaches 90% accuraccy after 20 epochs and
a 3 layers convolutional neural network that reaches 99.1% accuraccy
after 20 epochs. Both accuracy results are on the test set.
